<h1>Hello World!</h1>

<p>Hi. I'm Brian Lewis. Barista, a cappella enthusiast, Pokemon Master, and aspiring front-end developer.</p>

<p>I've decided to blog about my efforts in being more prolific while also using this space to document my various (future) projects. And all that starts with learning Jekyll.</p>

<p>This space will eventually be filled with posts about my discoveries, links to helpful articles, and anything else that helps to guide or inspire me. But for now, all you get is this message.</p>
